## Install

Step 1: install from pip:

```bash
pip install cliz
```

Step 2: make config file:

mkdir -p ~/.cliz
vim ~/.cliz/cliz.yaml

This is a template yaml, write your LLMs provider, and add any tools you like. This is my [config](cliz.yaml):

```yaml
auto: false # disable auto mode
respond_language: "English" # you can switch language to "‰∏≠Êñá"
llm:
  base_url: "xxx" # set your favorite LLMs
  api_key: "xxx"
  model: "xxx"
tools: # add more tools you like!
